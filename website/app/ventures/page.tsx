            <p>
              Following Ugobe's bankruptcy in 2009, John emerged with valuable insights from the Pleo
              experience. Rather than viewing the closure as a setback, he saw it as a learning
              opportunity that would inform his next ventures.
            </p>
            <p>
              John identified a fundamental challenge that had contributed to Ugobe's difficulties:
              "the one company tried to do too much, working on both hardware and software." This
              realization led him to found two complementary companies, each with a focused mission.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Vita Robotica represented John's ambitious vision to create "a completely new
                implementation of a brain for robots." Building on years of experience developing
                Pleo's sophisticated Life OS platform, John sought to create a more advanced,
                modular robotic intelligence system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The focus on separating the software intelligence layer reflected his understanding
                that robotic cognition required specialized expertise and dedicated development
                resources.

              <p>
                Complementing Vita Robotica, Pulse-Robotics concentrated on developing a robust
                robotic operating system. This company addressed the foundational software
                infrastructure needed to support complex robotic behaviors and interactions.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              Together, these companies reflected John's evolved vision for companion robotics.
              Rather than pursuing entertainment-focused toys, he shifted toward more practical
              therapeutic applications. His goal was to create companion robots that could serve
              as alternatives to therapy dogs, addressing real-world needs for emotional support
              and companionship.
            </p>

            <p className="text-memorial-gray-400 italic mt-6">
              This pivot toward therapeutic robotics demonstrated John's commitment to technology
              that meaningfully improved people's lives, extending beyond entertainment into the
              realm of healthcare and emotional wellbeing.

              The elegant design wasn't just aesthetic; the low heat generated by the LEDs meant
              users could actually hold the glowing globe in their hands, creating an intimate,
              tactile interaction with light itself.
