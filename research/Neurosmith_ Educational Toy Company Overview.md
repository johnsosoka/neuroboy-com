## Neurosmith: Educational Toy Company Overview

Neurosmith was an innovative educational toy company based in Long Beach, California, that specialized in electronic learning toys for infants and preschoolers. Founded in 1997 by **Brooke Abercrombie** and **John Sosoka**, the company gained recognition for creating award-winning products that combined child development research with high-quality sound technology and interactive play.[^1_1][^1_2]

### Founders and Background

The company was established by two former executives from Davidson \& Associates, a prominent educational software company best known for the Math Blaster program. Abercrombie, who held an MBA from Harvard University, served as vice president of product development at Davidson, while Sosoka was the chief technology officer overseeing software development. When Davidson \& Associates was sold in 1996 to CUC International (later Havas Interactive) for \$1.2 billion, Abercrombie and Sosoka decided to venture into the educational toy market.[^1_2][^1_3][^1_1]

The company secured \$5 million in startup funding from their former employers, Bob and Jan Davidson, who believed in the founders' vision to bring educational principles to the toy industry. Neurosmith operated from a small second-floor office in the Wells Fargo Bank building in the Belmont Shore area of Long Beach.[^1_1][^1_2]

### Product Line

Neurosmith developed several distinctive educational toys focused on music, language learning, and early childhood development:

#### Music Blocks (1999)

The company's flagship product, Music Blocks, allowed toddlers to compose over one million unique musical compositions by mixing and matching five brightly colored electronic blocks. Each block played a different musical phrase, and each side of each block offered a variation of that phrase. The toy retailed for \$69.99 and featured cartridges with different musical selections, including Mozart's music, Sounds of the Orchestra, and Rhythms of the World. Music Blocks combined sophisticated electronics with durable design, teaching children about colors, shapes, sequence, and cause-and-effect relationships.[^1_4][^1_5][^1_6][^1_7][^1_1]

#### Musini (2002)

One of Neurosmith's most innovative products, Musini featured a revolutionary motion sensor technology that converted children's movements into music. The toy's patented MagicSensor detected vibrations from movement, allowing any room to become a musical playground where every step, turn, touch, and tap activated a unique musical response. Musini offered five musical styles: Basically Bach, Child's Play, Latin Jazz, Carnival, and Orchestral Overture. The toy retailed for \$69.99 and was compatible with expansion cartridges for additional musical styles.[^1_8][^1_9][^1_10][^1_11][^1_12]

#### Sunshine Symphony

This plush, huggable activity toy featured a bright yellow sun design with eight tactile petals and played four classical music compositions: Mozart's Piano Sonata in C Major, Handel's Water Music, Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker, and Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf. When activated by touch, the toy produced lights and high-quality sound, and could operate in a long-play lullaby mode. The toy included tactile activities such as crinkle fabric, squeakers, beads, and a teether.[^1_13][^1_14][^1_15][^1_16]

#### Phonics Blocks and Phonics Tiles

These products helped children explore the correlation between sounds and letters through interactive play. Phonics Tiles featured four modes of play, fun letter songs, interactive games, and over 600 high-frequency words programmed into the system.[^1_10][^1_17][^1_18][^1_1]

#### Language Learning Toys

**The Babbler**: An infant toy that exposed babies to sounds in Spanish, French, and Japanese to facilitate language learning later in life. The \$49 toy randomly produced sounds unique to these languages that infants in English-speaking homes weren't typically exposed to.[^1_19][^1_2][^1_1]

**Little Linguist**: A bilingual learning toy that helped children learn languages by hearing words and associating them with familiar objects, then using them in simple sentences. The toy came with interchangeable cartridges for Spanish, French, and Japanese, in addition to English.[^1_20][^1_21][^1_22][^1_23][^1_1]

#### Other Products

- **Jumbo Music Block**: A 14-inch plush block with six sides featuring different shapes and colors, playing songs about shapes while teaching motor skills[^1_24][^1_25][^1_26]
- **Pet Me Platypus**: A musical plush toy with geometric shape buttons (later recalled in 2003)[^1_27][^1_28][^1_29]
- **Together Tunes Musical Cube**: A cube featuring six songs with lift-up flaps[^1_30]
- **Alphabet Ball**: An educational ball for learning letters and sounds[^1_31]


### Awards and Recognition

Neurosmith products received numerous prestigious awards from industry organizations:

**Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Awards**

- **Platinum Award** for Music Blocks Maestro, the highest recognition for innovative and engaging products[^1_32][^1_11][^1_4]
- **Blue Chip Classic Award** for Music Blocks, recognizing outstanding products that remain relevant over time[^1_32]
- Music Blocks was praised by the Oppenheim Family and featured on major network TV morning talk shows in 1999[^1_1]

**Parents Magazine**

- **Best Toys of the Year** recognition for Music Blocks in 1999[^1_1]

**Other Accolades**

- Musini received a **Platinum Best Toy Award**[^1_33]
- Multiple Neurosmith products won awards in 2006, including recognition from the Creative Child Foundation and Dr. Toy awards[^1_34]

The publicity from these awards provided crucial visibility for the company, which was too small to afford major advertising campaigns.[^1_1]

### Press Coverage and Media Attention

Neurosmith received significant media attention for its innovative approach to educational toys:

- Featured in **Time Magazine** (February 2002), which described Musini as "the most innovative musical toy" at the Toy Fair[^1_12]
- Coverage in the **Los Angeles Times** profiled the company's challenges and successes[^1_35][^1_2][^1_1]
- The **Los Angeles Business Journal** featured the founders' entrepreneurial journey in 2000[^1_1]
- The company's products were discussed on **NBC's TODAY Show** through Oppenheim Toy Portfolio coverage[^1_36]
- Featured in child development and educational technology publications for integrating neuroscience research into toy design[^1_10][^1_2]


### Business Challenges and Evolution

Neurosmith faced significant challenges in its early years. The company experienced a disastrous first Christmas when manufacturing problems with a Chinese factory delayed Music Blocks production until after the 1998 holiday season, leaving them with no revenues that year. The factory, accustomed to making simpler plastic toys, lacked the technical sophistication to produce the complicated electronic toys on schedule.[^1_2][^1_1]

After this setback, Neurosmith hired a new factory experienced with digital toys and a director of manufacturing. By 1999, they successfully sold 100,000 Music Blocks units, generating \$5 million in revenue. The company sold products through major retailers including FAO Schwartz, Learning Express, Toys R Us, Zany Brainy, and later Target.[^1_27][^1_1]

At its peak, Neurosmith posted sales of approximately \$12 million annually around 2000-2002. However, the company later faced difficulties finding shelf space due to higher prices compared to competitors, lack of advertising budget, and shipping disruptions.[^1_35]

### Acquisition and Closure

In **September 2004**, Small World Kids Inc., a Culver City-based developmental toy company, acquired Neurosmith's assets (including electronic learning products and intellectual property) for an undisclosed amount. Small World Kids CEO Debra Fine aimed to leverage the Neurosmith brand name and product line by cutting costs, lowering prices, and beginning advertising campaigns. The acquisition was supported by a \$16.5 million credit facility from PNC Business Credit.[^1_37][^1_38][^1_39][^1_40][^1_35]

Under Small World Kids, some Neurosmith products continued to be sold, and the company won additional awards in 2006. However, Small World Kids itself faced financial difficulties and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 2007, ultimately going out of business. As of the 2003 Pet Me Platypus recall update in 2004, Neurosmith as a company entity was noted to be out of business.[^1_28][^1_29][^1_41][^1_34]

### Legacy and Philosophy

Neurosmith distinguished itself through several key principles:

**Child Development Focus**: The company integrated research from neuroscientists and child development experts into product design. They worked with advisors like Morten Christiansen, a neuroscientist at Southern Illinois University, to understand how infants learn and develop cognitive skills.[^1_2]

**Sound Quality Excellence**: Neurosmith utilized the highest available sound quality in their musical toys, featuring CD-quality audio with sophisticated electronics that surpassed many competitors.[^1_13][^1_10][^1_1]

**Open-Ended Learning**: Products were designed to allow unlimited, creative play patterns that grew with children, encouraging exploration rather than following prescribed scripts.[^1_42][^1_5]

**Testing and Refinement**: All products were tested on children and scrutinized by mothers in focus groups before release.[^1_6][^1_1]

The company's story exemplifies both the innovation and challenges of educational toy manufacturing, demonstrating how quality products and research-based design could create award-winning toys, even as small companies struggled with manufacturing complexity and market pressures.[^1_35][^1_2][^1_1]
