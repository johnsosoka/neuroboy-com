## Ugobe and Pleo: The Rise and Fall of an Ambitious Robotic Toy Company

Ugobe was an American robotics company founded in 2001 (initially as Vernier Networks) that achieved fame with Pleo, a lifelike robotic baby dinosaur toy that redefined consumer robotics in the mid-2000s. Despite critical acclaim and innovative technology, the company struggled financially and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2009.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3][^1_4][^1_5]

### Company Founders and Leadership

Ugobe was co-founded by **Caleb Chung**, **Bob Christopher**, and **John Sosoka**. Chung, the inventor of the wildly successful Furby (which sold over 50 million units worldwide), brought extensive experience in animatronic toy design. Bob Christopher served as CEO and raised over \$26 million in funding for the company. John Sosoka, who previously served as CTO at educational toy company Neurosmith, acted as Chief Technology Officer.[^1_6][^1_7][^1_8][^1_9][^1_10][^1_11][^1_12][^1_13]

The company was initially based in Emeryville, California, with a design and R\&D facility in Eagle, Idaho. In October 2008, facing financial pressures, Ugobe consolidated all operations to Eagle, Idaho, eliminating its California headquarters.[^1_4][^1_9][^1_14]

### Product Line: Pleo

#### Original Pleo (2007-2009)

Pleo was unveiled at the DEMO Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona on February 7, 2006, where it received enthusiastic reception. The robot was designed to resemble a week-old baby Camarasaurus dinosaur and featured groundbreaking technology for consumer robotics.[^1_1][^1_15][^1_2]

**Technical Specifications:**[^1_15][^1_16]

- **Processors:** Two ARM7 32-bit processors (main controller and image/sound processing) plus four 8-bit microcontrollers for motor control
- **Motors:** 14 motors providing 14 degrees of freedom
- **Sensors:** Over three dozen sensors including:
    - Color camera
    - Infrared transmitter/receiver
    - Temperature sensor
    - RFID reader
    - Two microphones
    - Ground foot sensors
    - Orientation and motion sensors
    - Touch sensors (head, chin, cheeks, shoulder, back, and thigh)
- **Skin:** Soft thermoplastic elastomer material
- **Software:** Life OS software platform controlling sensors, actuators, and AI systems
- **Connectivity:** USB port and SD card slot
- **Power:** Lithium-polymer battery providing approximately one hour of playtime per four-hour charge[^1_16]
- **Dimensions:** 50.8 cm length × 17.8 cm height × 12.7 cm width
- **Weight:** 1.6 kg

The robot was designed to exhibit lifelike movement and behavior, responding to touch, sound, and environmental changes. Pleo would develop through three stages: "hatching," "infant," and "juvenile," with its personality shaped by how it was treated. The robot could express moods, exhibit behaviors like sleeping when ignored, and wag its tail when given attention.[^1_7][^1_17][^1_1][^1_16]

**Pricing and Availability:**

- Originally announced for \$200 and Christmas 2006 release[^1_18][^1_19]
- Actually launched December 5, 2007 at \$350[^1_20][^1_1]
- Later sold for approximately \$280-\$350 on various retail channels[^1_2][^1_7]


#### Life OS Software Platform

The Life OS was Ugobe's proprietary software platform that enabled Pleo's autonomous behavior, adaptive learning, and emotional responses. The system used PAWN scripting language running on a virtual machine, allowing developers to modify behaviors and create custom applications. Ugobe released software updates including Life OS 1.1 in March 2008, which added features like sitting, singing, calling for attention, and getting sick.[^1_21][^1_22][^1_23]

### Awards and Recognition

Pleo received significant industry recognition:

- **TIME Magazine Best Inventions of 2006**: Featured as "The Doting Dinosaur" among the best inventions of the year[^1_17][^1_24][^1_25]
- **Popular Science**: Named one of the coolest inventions of 2007[^1_8]
- **Extensive Media Coverage**: Featured in The Wall Street Journal, Wired Magazine, Forbes Magazine, on NBC's "Nightline," ABC's "The Today Show," and numerous other outlets[^1_2][^1_26][^1_4][^1_7][^1_9]

### Patents and Intellectual Property

Ugobe accumulated substantial intellectual property during its existence. The bankruptcy filing listed **16 patents, 60 invention disclosures** for potential future patents, and numerous trademarks. Key patents included:[^1_4]

1. **US20080058988A1 - "Robots with Autonomous Behavior"** (granted March 6, 2008): Inventors Caleb Chung and John R. Sosoka. This patent covered methods for operating robots in response to environmental changes by determining dominant drive states, selecting appropriate behavior strategies, and executing robotic motions.[^1_27]
2. **USD614251S - "Robotic Eye"** (design patent, granted April 20, 2010): Inventor Caleb Chung, assigned to Ugobe Inc., Jetta Industries Company Limited, and Innvo Labs Limited.[^1_28]

The patents reflected Ugobe's innovative approach to creating robots with lifelike behaviors driven by internal motivational models rather than simple programmed responses.[^1_27]

### Sales and Market Performance

Despite the hype and positive reception, Pleo struggled in the marketplace:

- **Total Sales:** Approximately 100,000 units sold worldwide[^1_2][^1_29][^1_30]
- **Geographic Distribution:** 60% Europe, 30% Asia, 10% North America[^1_2]
- **Revenue:** The company reported \$19.2 million in gross income in 2008 and \$209,669 in early 2009 before bankruptcy[^1_4]

Ugobe had projected sales of over 1 million units, but the actual performance fell far short. The high price point (\$280-\$350) during an economic downturn, combined with marketing challenges and battery life issues, limited consumer adoption.[^1_29][^1_31][^1_30][^1_32][^1_2]

### Company Collapse and Bankruptcy

Multiple factors contributed to Ugobe's demise:

1. **Economic Downturn:** The 2008 financial crisis severely impacted consumer spending on luxury toys[^1_29][^1_5]
2. **Excessive Overhead:** The company had grown rapidly with expensive infrastructure anticipating explosive growth that never materialized[^1_29]
3. **Manufacturing Delays:** Initial release delays of over a year due to manufacturing problems[^1_26]
4. **Product Issues:** Battery life problems, slow movement, noisy gear sounds, and paint flaking disappointed some customers[^1_31]
5. **Funding Difficulties:** Credit market collapse prevented the company from raising its final funding round[^1_2][^1_29]

**Timeline of Decline:**[^1_4][^1_2][^1_29]

- **November 2008:** Derek Dotson returned to help save the company; Doug Swanson brought in as CEO
- **December 2008:** Most employees laid off; CEO Bob Christopher resigned
- **Late December 2008:** Entire board of directors resigned, returning control to co-founders
- **January 2009:** Liz Gasper (former CFO) departed; Caleb Chung returned to leadership
- **April 17, 2009:** Filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy listing \$1.6 million in assets and \$3.6 million in liabilities

Major creditors included \$353,500 owed to each co-founder (Caleb Chung and Derek Dotson) in royalties, \$604,161 to manufacturer Jetta Company Ltd., and \$284,468 to Arrow Electronics.[^1_4]

### Resurrection: Jetta and Innvo Labs

On May 21, 2009, at the bankruptcy auction, **Jetta Company Limited** (the Hong Kong-based manufacturer that had produced Pleo for Ugobe) acquired all intellectual property rights and assets. Jetta, established in 1977 with 32 years of manufacturing experience, committed to continuing the Pleo line.[^1_33][^1_34][^1_35][^1_36]

In July 2009, Jetta established **Innvo Labs Corporation** as a division to manage the Pleo brand. Derek Dotson, one of Ugobe's original founders, became COO of Innvo Labs.[^1_1][^1_37][^1_38]

#### Pleo rb (Reborn) - 2011

Innvo Labs launched the next generation, **Pleo rb** (standing for "ReBorn"), in December 2011. The updated version included:[^1_39][^1_40][^1_37]

- Voice recognition system (works with any language)
- Internal clock with time-of-day awareness
- Temperature sensors
- RFID-based "learning stone" technology for feeding and commands
- More touch sensors
- Improved durability
- Personality pre-setting in factory (male vs. female tendencies)
- Multiple color variations (green, pink, blue)
- Price: \$469[^1_15][^1_41][^1_40][^1_39]

The Pleo rb maintained the core design while pushing the original platform to its technical limits.[^1_39]

### Press Coverage and Cultural Impact

Ugobe and Pleo generated extensive media attention:

**Major Publications:**

- Wall Street Journal featured the company and product multiple times[^1_2][^1_26]
- TIME Magazine's Best Inventions recognition brought international attention[^1_17][^1_24]
- Wired Magazine featured Pleo in cover stories and detailed technical reviews[^1_7][^1_20][^1_2]
- Forbes Magazine named Caleb Chung one of the nation's top 10 innovators[^1_8]

**Television Appearances:**

- NBC's "Nightline"[^1_4][^1_9]
- "The Today Show"[^1_9][^1_4]
- Featured on various tech review programs[^1_42]

**Industry Impact:**
Pleo represented a significant milestone in consumer robotics, bridging the gap between simple robotic toys (like Furby) and advanced robotics platforms (like Sony's AIBO). It demonstrated that lifelike movement and emotional engagement were achievable in consumer products, though the company's failure also highlighted the challenges of bringing expensive robotic toys to market.[^1_1][^1_29][^1_30][^1_2]

### Legacy

Despite Ugobe's bankruptcy, Pleo achieved several notable accomplishments:

1. **Technical Achievement:** First consumer robot with truly lifelike movements and sophisticated behavioral AI[^1_7][^1_16]
2. **Emotional Engagement:** Successfully created emotional connections between users and a robotic pet[^1_2][^1_6]
3. **Developer Community:** Inspired a dedicated community of hackers and developers who continued modifying and programming their Pleos[^1_23]
4. **Market Lessons:** The "2 Year Itch" concept, developed by Bob Christopher and Greg Appelhof based on Ugobe's experience, became a guide for hardware startups navigating retail markets[^1_43]

Pleo remains available through Innvo Labs' PLEOworld website, though current inventory shows as "out of stock". The product continues to have devoted fans and is studied by researchers exploring human-robot interaction.[^1_44][^1_16]
